# Summary
This project focused on creating monthly retention cohorts of The Look E-Commerce (fictitious clothing site in Google Bigquery) in 2019 - 2022. I created monthly retention cohorts based on the date that a user purchased a product and then analyze how many of them (%) coming back for the following month. After that, I created hypotheses of the analysis and suggested a business recommendation based upon that.
