# Summary
This project focused on creating monthly retention cohorts of The Look E-Commerce (fictitious clothing site in Google Bigquery) in 2019 - 2022. I created monthly retention cohorts based on the date that a user purchased a product and then analyze how many of them (%) coming back for the following month. After that, I created hypotheses of the analysis and suggested a business recommendation based upon that.

## Data Analysis & Visualization
The result of the query was being processed on Google Sheet for further analysis https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12KKWA1zgr-6FSK8dLNrhgOQG6Xv_yECMdqzlCNpDmZQ/edit?usp=sharing

The query resulted a monthly retention cohorts based upon the first date of a userâ€™s purchase and the following months in 2019 - 2022. However for the further analysis I analyzed the time frame of the latest 1 year (2021-2022) to measure their latest user engagement for the next marketing strategy.

The total user in each cohort month showed an upward trend in a year (number of user increasing over time).

The retention curve showed the retention of the cohorts over time, out of all new users during the time range (48131 users), 10.18% were retained on 1 month after, 5.66% on 6 months after, and 2.44% on 12 months after.
